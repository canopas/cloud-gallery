## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: April 24, 2024**

#### Introduction

Canopas Software LLP ("Canopas," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information related to your use of our mobile application, Cloud Gallery.

#### Information We Collect

We collect two categories of information through the App:

* **Account Information:** If you choose to link your account with a third-party storage provider (e.g., Google Drive), we access only the minimal necessary information, such as your name and email address, for authentication and verification purposes. We do not collect or store any other personal data from your linked account.
* **Usage Data:** Automatically collected information about your usage of the App, including device type, operating system, IP address, and browsing activity within the App, as well as the date and time of use.

#### Storage Provider Information

If you link your account with a third-party storage provider (e.g., Google Drive), Cloud Gallery acts as a medium to enable you to:

* View, upload, download, and delete photos and videos stored in your Google Drive, only at your instruction.
* Perform automatic backups to your selected storage provider, if enabled by you.

**Important Information:** Cloud Gallery does not store, process, or retain any of your media files. Your media remains under your control, stored exclusively on your chosen storage provider's account (e.g, Google Drive). We access your provider's data solely to facilitate the services you request within the App and do not retain any of this data on our servers.

#### How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* Authenticate your account and enable secure access.
* Display your photos and videos stored in your linked storage provider account (e.g., Google Drive), if linked.
* Facilitate actions such as uploading, downloading, and deleting files in your chosen storage provider account (at your instruction).
* Perform automatic backups to your selected storage provider (if enabled by you).
* Improve and personalize the App experience.
* Send notification reminders for auto-backups (if enabled by you).
* Comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

#### Sharing Your Information

* We do not share your local media or data from your chosen storage provider (e.g., Google Drive) with third parties.

* We may share usage data with third-party service providers who assist us in App operations. These providers are bound by strict privacy obligations.

* We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and property.

##### Data Retention

* We do not store any of your media files on our servers.

* We may retain usage data for a limited period to troubleshoot issues and improve the App.

#### Your Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for managing, backing up, and protecting your media stored on your selected storage provider account (e.g., Google Drive). Canopas is not responsible for data loss, corruption, or any issues related to your media.

#### Your Choices

* Control your Google Drive link through the App settings.

* Manage your media and permissions directly via your App settings or the storage provider's settings.

* Opt out of receiving notification reminders through the App settings.

* Opt out of automatic backups through the App settings.

#### Security

We take reasonable measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no electronic storage method is completely secure.

#### Children's Privacy

Cloud Gallery is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under this age.

#### Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it regularly.
