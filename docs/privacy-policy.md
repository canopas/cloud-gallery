### Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: April 24, 2024**

**Introduction**

Canopas Software LLP ("Canopas," "we," "us," or "our") respects the privacy of our users ("you" or "your"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information in connection with your use of our mobile application, Cloud Gallery App.

**Information We Collect**

We collect two categories of information through the App:

* **Local Device Information:** This information is stored directly on your device and includes your photos and videos. Cloud Gallery requests permission to access your local photos and videos solely to allow you to view them within the App. We do not collect or store any of your local photos or videos on our servers.
* **Usage Data:** This information is automatically collected about your App usage and may include the type of device you use, operating system, IP address, browsing activity within the App, and the date and time of your App usage.

**Google Drive Information (Optional)**

If you choose to link your Google Drive account to the App, we utilize Google Sign-in with drive scope for authentication purposes. This grants us access to your basic profile information (name and email address) solely to verify your identity. We do not store any other Google account information.

Optionally, linking your Google Drive allows you to:

* View photos and videos stored in your Drive within Cloud Gallery.
* Upload photos and videos to your Drive.
* Download photos and videos from your Drive.
* Delete photos and videos from your Drive (at your instruction).
* Perform automatic backups to your Drive (with your permission).

We emphasize that we only access your Drive data to display it within the App and perform actions as instructed by you. We do not store any of your Drive data on our servers.

**How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* To enable you to view your local photos and videos within the App.
* To display your photos and videos stored in Google Drive (if linked).
* To facilitate functionalities like upload, download, and deletion of photos and videos in your Drive (if linked).
* To perform automatic backups to your Drive (if enabled by you).
* To improve and personalize the App experience.
* To send notification reminders for auto-backups (if enabled by you).
* To comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

**Sharing Your Information**

We do not share your local photos and videos with any third party.

We will not share any information from your Google Drive with any third party without your prior consent.

We may share information with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App, such as cloud storage providers. These third parties are obligated to adhere to strict privacy standards as outlined in our agreements with them.

We may also disclose your information if required by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal process, protect our rights, or defend our property.

**Data Retention**

We do not store any of your local photos and videos or your Drive data on our servers.

We may retain usage data for a limited period for troubleshooting purposes and to improve the App.

**Your Choices**

You have control over your local device photo and video permissions through your device settings.

You can choose to link or unlink your Google Drive at any time.

You can manage your Google Drive data directly through your Google Drive settings.

You can opt out of receiving notification reminders for auto-backups within the App settings.

**Security**

We take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet or electronic storage system is completely secure.

**Children's Privacy**

Our App is not directed towards children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on this page.
